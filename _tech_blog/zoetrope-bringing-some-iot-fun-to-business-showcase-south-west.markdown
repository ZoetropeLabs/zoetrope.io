Zoetrope exhibited their IoT consultancy offering at the Business Showcase South West show on the 14th and 15th of May, the decision to attend the show was taken at quite short notice and we had only limited time to put together an engaging and fun display. We decided to take the IoT tank game, which demonstrates how we can simply internet connect a collection of small low powered devices and have them all talk to each other and a central server.

The tanks generated a huge amount of interest, with people particularly engaged by the use of a phone's accelorometer to control the steering on the tank.  Most delegates we spoke to had heard of the Internet of Things, but had not seen many practical examples.  We found they were also suprised by the low cost of IoT components 

The biggest technical difficulty we faced involved wifi connectivity. We decided to run our own local wifi network rather than rely on the conference provider's, however we had intermittent issues throughout the day and a quick network scan revealed the official wifi broadcasting a very strong signal on all wifi channels. We may look at switching to a bluetooth based setup for future shows.

We also ran into classic battery life issues, sadly one of our two ebay tanks gave up the ghost fairly early in the show - meaning we had to regularly pause the game whilst we charged the tank. We will raid ebay for some spare tanks for future shows, or look at a setting up a removable battery pack so we can precharge and hot swap out the battery.

The tanks will be making their next appearance at VentureFest Bristol - where we are fortunate enough to be one of the select few exhibitors invited to the start-up village : http://venturefestbristolandbath.com/
