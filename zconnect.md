      This hardware is tailored around what's already in the product; we can add new sensors to collect data or use existing sensors and just add the required hardware to connect the product to the internet via 3G, wi-fi or LPWA.

      Throughout our consultive process we design, improve and refine the hardware to ensure that the final product will be built to provide maximum business value for you.
