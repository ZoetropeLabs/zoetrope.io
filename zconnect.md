      ZConnect has been released as an open source project, meaning you can be safe in the knowledge that you're organisation will never be dependent on a third party vendor for licencing of your connected product platform.

      ZConnect has considered security from the ground up and role-based permissions come as standard. Create groups and organisations to only give access to the data which is required for a particular party.
