    text: |
      ZConnect is a connected product system for OEMs who want to add connectivity to existing products, or for companies looking to create new connected products. This applies across almost all industries from white goods, through to factory tooling, to agricultural equipment.

      Through modules, ZConnect can rapidly have new functionality added to allow for bespoke data display, integration with other platforms, or support for new connected products.

      Zoetrope created ZConnect as a common platform which is freely available and open source

      ZConnect can ingest data streams from multiple data sources to allow remote monitoring and easy diagnosis of faults on remote systems. 

      Taking this one step further, ZConnect is also able to alert users when devices do not appear to be operating normally in order to allow proactive servicing.

      Connected products open up new possibilities for collecting and storing data about the operation of equipment and movement of goods.

      Create maps, graphs and reports of everything from panic button activations to application of weed killer!

  - title: Open source, easy choice
    text: |
      ZConnect has been released as an open source project, meaning you can be safe in the knowledge that you're organisation will never be dependent on a third party vendor for licencing of your connected product platform.   

      ZConnect has considered security from the ground up and role-based permissions come as standard. Create groups and organisations to only give access to the data which is required for a particular party.
