I previously worked as a paramedic but made the switch to coding because I missed the creativity . I've always enjoyed making things and have a long list of hardware and software project ideas on the backlog so working at Zoetrope has been a great fit for me.

At Zoetrope I primarily work on the front end; mobile and web apps. I enjoy the process of taking a project spec and using the latest technologies to make it real. I've found it a great environment to learn new skills and find new applications for my existing ones.
