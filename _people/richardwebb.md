I met Ben while doing my Masters in Computer Science and Electronics. After a stint in Silicon Valley and building software for one of the UKâ€™s largest financial institutions, he asked me to join him in starting Zoetrope.

I love that I am developing my skills and practising new uses for them every day. From electronics and PCB design to developing embedded and API software; they are all useful for our projects.
