I have always been entrepreneurial; I launched my first tech start-up while I was completing my Masters in Computer Science and Electronics at Bristol University.

Iâ€™m motivated by solving problems and I am passionate about technology; I find the potential that the Internet of Things holds for growing businesses really exciting, so I founded Zoetrope. I love working with our clients, delivering a remarkable solution to the new challenges that each one poses.
