I've been a programmer almost as long as I can remember, from BASIC and GameMaker through to JaveScript and Python. I studied Maths at university before returning to programming and the exciting world of startups. I even gave founding one a try at EF, a startup accelerator for technical graduates, then worked at one of EF's earlier companies, a marketplace for office space, as a full-stack developer.

At Zoetrope I'm a full-stack developer with a focus on front-end development and design.
