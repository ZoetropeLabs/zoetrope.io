After completing a Masters in Physics at Durham University, I decided to become a software developer. I particularly enjoyed working on a project for an X-ray metrology company, creating 3D visualisations of the compositions of the X-ray’s wafer chips, in order to find defects.

At Zoetrope, I develop server software in Python and native mobile apps in React. I enjoy the agile environment of Zoetrope; I’m able to work with cutting-edge technology and I’m constantly learning new things.
