I first used my Masters in Computer science and Electronics in internal scalability and parallel computing for high-performance computing. Creating scientific simulations of super-computing with emerging technologies, I travelled around the world and was published a couple of times in scientific journals.

At Zoetrope, I develop embedded software with yocto, back-end software and web apps. I like that we get to know the whole story of the product - using the latest technology to build something all the way from the hardware to the apps.
