Before joining Zoetrope I worked as a robotics engineer in the defence sector. I received my bachelor's degree in robotics in 2015 and went on to work in the smart agriculture sector. I then moved onto Babcock where I worked on a number of large projects including a military communications upgrade for a NATO member state and some robot swarm R&D projects. 

As Solutions Manager as Zoetrope, I provide the interface between the technical team and clients.
