Once I had completed my PhD in the physical sciences, I continued on at Oxford University as a research scientist while also learning software development. At Zoetrope I’m applying my knowledge both to create web APIs for our products and use my data science experience to create insight.

I enjoy working in the small, close-knit team at Zoetrope. My contributions to projects make a difference to our clients’ diverse range of businesses and I can use my extensive interest and knowledge in data science to develop our predictive analytics
