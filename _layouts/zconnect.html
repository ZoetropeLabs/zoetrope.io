                <p>This hardware is tailored around what’s already in the product; we can add new sensors to collect data or use existing sensors and just add the required hardware to connect the product to the internet via 3G, wi-fi or LPWA.</p>
                <p>The hardware can mount onto existing products, which is especially cost-effective and great for prototyping. We can also work with your product designers to seamlessly integrate the required hardware into your product. </p>
                <p>Throughout our consultative process, we design, improve and refine the hardware to ensure that the final product will be built to provide the maximum business value for you.</p>
