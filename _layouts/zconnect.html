            <h3>We create hardware that will interface with your product’s existing electronics to collect useful data</h3>
            <p>This hardware is tailored around what’s already in the product; we can add new sensors to collect data or use existing sensors and just add the required hardware to connect the product to the internet via 3G, wi-fi or LPWA.</p>
            <p>Throughout our consultative process, we design, improve and refine the hardware to ensure that the final product will be built to provide the maximum business value for you.</p>

            <h3>Easy to use apps for your end-users, distributors and other stakeholders</h3>
            <p>ZConnect has base apps which we will customise for your business. These can be customised for several scenarios:
            <ol>
              <li>Notify the status of a product to service personnel when something breaks </li>
              <li>Allow end users to see the location of their products and vital stats</li>
              <li>Allow business owners to see the cost and productivity of their equipment</li>
            </ol>
            Each of these and more can be presented to users through our apps - Android, iOS and Web.</p>
            <p>ZConnect has considered security from the ground up and role-based permissions come as standard. Create groups and organisations to only give access to the data which is required for a particular party.</p>
