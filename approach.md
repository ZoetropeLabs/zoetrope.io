      We'll help you run a trial of your prototype IoT system which will help identify strengths and weaknesses of the solution before deciding what features to roll into a real product.

      Upon working with you to finalise which features to take forward, we'll integrate connectivity into your products in a production-ready capacity.

      You and your customers start benefiting from the new connectivity of your product and the actionable insight from day one. Licensing of the product includes email and phone support from us, to give you peace of mind and to ensure that everything is working correctly.

      We provide consultation for continually developing your product alongside your business. If you want to take maintenance, support and development in house, we will work with you to ensure a smooth transition.
