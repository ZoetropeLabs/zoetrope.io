## Who is Zoetrope?
Zoetrope is a young and fast growing technology consultancy focusing on IoT, based in Bristol. We pride ourselves on being the whole package - from transistor, to 3D print, to server, to web interface. We work on projects both with multinationals and startups as the virtual technology team, helping to drive the specification, prototyping and implementation of the client’s product. We’ve grown quickly over the last year and are looking for more people to join as the 5th and 6th employees.

No two projects are ever the same and you’ll get to work with a wide variety of amazing companies.

We maintain a technology blog here: https://zoetrope.io/tech-blog. We’d love to know what you think.

## Who Zoetrope is looking for:
We’re looking for a electronic engineer to join our Bristol team.

An ideal candidate will be passionate about electronics. Our projects often include digital electronics with an SoC or SoM, integrating with analogue or digital interfaced sensors. A knowledge of C/C++ is a must.

Given the size of the team (currently 4), it’s essential that we find an all rounder who will be happy to muck in and help complete the project.

**Required:**
1. Either a relevant BSc/MEng or overwhelming proof of achievement
2. History of project based work - working in a development team. 
3. Good knowledge of digital electronics, ARM processors etc.

1. Electronics/Robotics experience
2. 3D printing knowledge
3. C/C++ or Javascript experience
4. Linux skills
5. Hardware build experience

## What’s in it for you?

We’ll set you up with a new computer or laptop of your choice (standard issue being a dual-monitor linux box) and make sure you have everything you need to work effectively.
You’ll have plenty of space in our offices & workshop, you can have your own room if you like. (In Bristol, moving to Clifton Triangle area)
You’ll work in a small and agile team alongside the founder - no hierarchies or matrices.
We’ll be flexible to working outside normal hours and remoting working some of the time, though working face-to-face with the team is important too.
Competitive based on experience, equity available through EMI options to the right candidate.
