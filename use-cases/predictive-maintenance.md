      - the ZConnect team will work with you to understand your product and use your teams expert knowledge of your product to make a monitoring sytsem which will detect any abnormailities on your devices. This allows you to obverse problems such as part wear or damage to your product before your customer even realises anything is wrong.
      - A typical way to use this functionality is to raise low priority issues before they become big issues. This can either be used to order parts, or shedule a visit to the customer to make a repair. This reduces the downtime and the percieved response time.

    lines:
      - Being able to attend to issues before they become critical offers an opportunity to smooth peaks and trough in demand - e.g. AC units with pre-existing problems are more likely to fail on a particuarly hot day. Knowing and fixing the weak ones on cooler days before the customer is aware of the problem can help make better use of your staff as well as improving their visibility of upcoming work.
