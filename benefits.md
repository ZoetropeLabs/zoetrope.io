heading: The benefits of ZConnect
subheading: ZConnect is a flexible toolkit - the following are some great examples of the kinds of ways in which ZConnect can be used, however they are by no means an exhaustive list. Many projects will not cleanly fit in to a single use-case category, however this is where ZConnect really excels!

hero_cta_heading: ZConnect for remote monitoring and predictive maintenance
hero_cta_content: ZConnect can help you build up a model of what sensor input is recieved normally when the system is functioning correctly - this alone allows many problems to be identified very quickly by someone with knowledge of the system. ZConnect can go one step further and provide your organisation with the ability to get alerted automatically with details of specific problems on machinery and how to fix them.

          With remote and predictive maintenance, ZConnect is able to warn when product values are outside of expected values. For some systems this allows for being able to detect signs of wear and tear, incorrect calibrations or user error. Events can be triggered on any of these conditions and anything from emailing a user better instructions to dispatching a service engineer can be the raised from the event.

        text: |
          With long term knowledge of the function of the product, it's possible to determine if serviceable parts can be updated or replaced during a service if it's cost effective compared to additional call-outs between services.

      In many situation service engineers spend a lot of time travelling to and from jobs. ZConnect predictive maintenance can make it easier to perform preventative maintenance when an engineer is already in the area, reducing the chance of unexpected downtime and reducing time spent travelling per job.

    title: ZConnect for compliance
    class: bg-grey-light
    text: |
      ZConnect has the ability to store events and data from sensors securely and accross multiple data stores to ensure regulatory compliance, or other immutable data stores for important sensor data. This may include data from machinery - e.g. application of fertilizer to a field, or may be the tightness of individual products on a factory line.

        text: |
          ZConnect can be easily customised to generate dashboards and reports as well as sending compliance trails to other data stores, such as the blockchain or amazon s3. Custom reports can also be generated and exported as PDF's, or sent to Excel.

        text: |
          With the ability to combine multiple data sources, ZConnect can help you quickly mashup data sources to store data sets which may have huge impacts on your business. This can allow you to store data for analysing how products are being used, what conditions they perform best in and how to improve areas where they don't.

      <h5>Help customers remotely</h5>
      ZConnect can allow your operators to remotely see the status of equipment and update settings and diagnose simple faults instantly. This can prevent virtually all callouts where user error is to blame, saving vast amounts of service engineer time and cost.
      <h5>Reconfigure settings on-the-fly</h5>
      With remote control ability, your operators can instantly update settings on remote devices, either to help users understand how they should be using their device, or to provide more optimal settings for their usecase.
      <h5>Save energy</h5>
      Allow users to remotely check on their devices and power them up or turn them off as required. Devices can automatically respond to external factors such as weather or the current electricity cost
