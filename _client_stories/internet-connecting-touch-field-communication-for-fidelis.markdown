## The Need
Oliver Spragg of Fidelis approached Zoetrope with the opportunity to take an exciting patent pending technology and make it ready for App developers to use as a building block in their applications.

Fidelis’ technology  delivers similar functionality to NFC. It is named Touch Field Communication “TFC”and involves reassuringly physical and secure phone to device contact whilst also facilitating interaction with webapps on the phones, not just downloaded apps. It is supported on all smart phones with a touch screen, rather than the sub 50%  of smart phones which have NFC. See the Fidellis website for more information.

**Zoetrope’s solution**
Zoetrope worked with Oliver to identify issues relating to the security and simplicity for developers looking to use Fidellis technology in their apps. 3 key issues were uncovered:

1.  By internet connecting the devices, it is possible to have far more secure single use codes
2.  A complete and documented RESTful API would make it far easier for app developers. to integrate with Fidelis technology.
3.  A polished demonstration of the technology with open source example apps would allow Fidelis to better promote their technology.

**The Outcome**

Zoetrope  successfully delivered on all 3 parts of the project, meaning that Fidelis is able to progress the business and partner with application developers.

Here’s what Oliver had to say about Zoetrope:
