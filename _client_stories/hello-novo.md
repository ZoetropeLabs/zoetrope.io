Zoetrope worked closely with [Novo](http://hellonovo.co.uk) to deliver a comlplete IoT solution that was scalable, secure and future proof. At the heart of Climair is ZConnect, an IoT cloud platform which provides the backbone of the entire system. Through ZConnect, Novo are able to rely upon a scalable, fault tolerant system to handle all their data ingress, analysis and trigger events.

Zoetrope labs was selected by Novo as their full-stack IoT partner and set to work, developing the high-level system architecture that would later become the backbone of Climair. 

## Zoetrope delivered to Novo:

1. Embedded software and remote updating for the ‘Novo SuperHub’ which allows up to 25 Climair devices iuna  home/business to connect back to the cloud.
2. A cloud platform which allows for tens of thousands of devices to connect up and for users to control the system.
3. A web administration interface to control the cloud system.
4. Android and iOS mobile apps for customers.

Zoetrope labs designed each of the elements of the system and produced specifications for the protocols used. The result is Climair, a system which allows customers to control their air conditioning via an app as well as setting up schedules and inviting family members to use the app.

Speaking of the collaboration, Nova Director Tom Timothy said, “It has been a pleasure working with Ben and his team at Zoetrope for the past year at Novo. Novo received a complete solution from a single vendor which reduced overall complexity of managing the delivery of the project.” 

## About Novo:

Novo was founded in 2015 as part of the e.on:agile accelerator programme, whose vision is to transform the way people interact with buildings. Novo’s first product, Climair leverages the power of the Internet of Things to existing air conditioning units; offering smart features and energy saving capabilities.
