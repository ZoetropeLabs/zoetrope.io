Zoetrope's ZConnect system is a complete IoT solution for empowering unconnected products with one or more of:

1. predictive maintenance
2. real time feedback and product status
3. remote control

These additional capabilities can take your product to the next level, with higher customer satisfaction, smoother utilisation of your service engineers and valuable usage data to feedback into product design.

This whitepaper focuses on the technical design of the ZConnect system which is aimed at technical directors or CTO's who are keen to understand more about what the platform does on a technical level.

A key point to keep in mind is that the hard work of system integration and protocol design has been completed by Zoetrope, which reduces project risk, lowers overall cost and increases productivity.
